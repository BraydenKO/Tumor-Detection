# Tumor-Detection
These scripts generate augmented data from a small dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
and save them if you'd like to anaylyse/see those new images.

buildCNN.py creates a model based on the VGG16 architecture 

trainCNN.py, as the name suggests, trains and saves the best model.
